//! This module defines the `SaltEnv` trait, which provides bucket capacity information for dynamic
//! gas pricing. Storage slots and accounts are organized into buckets, and the gas cost scales
//! with bucket capacity to incentivize efficient resource allocation.

/// # Block-Awareness
///
/// This trait does not take a block parameter. Block context is provided when the environment
/// is created via [`ExternalEnvFactory::external_envs`](crate::ExternalEnvFactory::external_envs),
/// allowing implementations to snapshot state at a specific block.
///
/// # Bucket ID Calculation
///
/// The trait provides default methods [`bucket_id_for_account`](SaltEnv::bucket_id_for_account)
/// and [`bucket_id_for_slot`](SaltEnv::bucket_id_for_slot) that can be overridden by
/// implementations to customize bucket assignment logic.

    /// ```
    /// This multiplier scales the base storage gas costs, making operations more expensive
