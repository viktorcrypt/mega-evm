/// `MegaInstructions` is the instruction table for `MegaETH`.
///
/// This instruction table implements a multi-dimensional gas model and customizes certain opcodes
/// for `MegaETH` specifications:
///
/// # Multi-Dimensional Gas Model
///
/// All instructions track gas usage across multiple dimensions:
/// - **Compute Gas**: Standard EVM operation costs (arithmetic, control flow, memory, etc.)
/// - **Storage Gas**: Dynamic costs for persistent storage operations (SSTORE, CREATE, CALL with
///   transfer)
/// - **Log Storage Gas**: Additional costs for persisting event logs (10x standard costs)
///
/// This separation allows for independent pricing and limiting of different resource types.
///
/// # Customized Opcodes
///
/// ## LOG Opcodes (LOG0-LOG4)
/// - Compute gas: Standard EVM costs (375 + 375×topics + `8×data_bytes`)
/// - Storage gas: 10x multiplier (3,750×topics + `80×data_bytes`)
/// - Data limit enforcement: Halts when total transaction data exceeds 3.125 MB
///
/// ## SELFDESTRUCT Opcode
/// - Disabled in Mini-Rex, Rex, and Rex1 specs
/// - Re-enabled in Rex2 with EIP-6780 semantics
/// - When disabled, halts with `InvalidFEOpcode` to prevent contract destruction
///
/// ## SSTORE Opcode
/// - Compute gas: Standard EIP-2200/EIP-2929 costs
/// - Storage gas: Dynamic bucket-based costs only when setting zero → non-zero
/// - Data/KV limit enforcement: Tracks 40 bytes + 1 KV update per storage slot modification
///
/// ## CREATE/CREATE2 Opcodes
/// - Compute gas: Standard costs (32,000 for CREATE, 6 gas/word for CREATE2 hashing)
/// - Storage gas: Dynamic bucket-based costs for new account creation
/// - Gas forwarding: 98/100 rule (2% withheld vs. standard 1.5%)
/// - Data/KV tracking: 40 bytes + 1 KV update per account creation
///
/// ## CALL-like Opcode
/// - Compute gas: Standard call costs
/// - Storage gas: Dynamic bucket-based costs for new account creation (when transferring to empty
///   account)
/// - Gas forwarding: 98/100 rule (2% withheld vs. standard 1.5%)
/// - Oracle detection: Handled at frame level (in `frame_init`), applies gas detention for both
///   direct transaction calls and internal CALL operations
/// - Data/KV tracking: 40 bytes + 2 KV updates when transferring to empty account
///
/// ## Volatile Data Access Opcodes
/// Block environment opcodes (TIMESTAMP, NUMBER, COINBASE, DIFFICULTY, GASLIMIT, BASEFEE,
/// BLOCKHASH, BLOBBASEFEE, BLOBHASH) and beneficiary-accessing opcodes (BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE,
/// EXTCODECOPY, EXTCODEHASH) implement immediate gas detention to prevent `DoS` attacks.
///
/// # Gas Detention Mechanism
///
/// When volatile data (block environment, beneficiary, or oracle) is accessed, the system
/// implements a global gas detention mechanism:
/// 1. Remaining gas is immediately limited based on the type of volatile data:
///    - Block environment or beneficiary: `BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_REMAINING_GAS` (20M gas)
///    - Oracle contract: `ORACLE_ACCESS_REMAINING_GAS` (1M gas pre-Rex3, 20M gas Rex3+)
/// 2. Most restrictive limit wins: If multiple volatile data types are accessed, the minimum (most
///    restrictive) limit applies, regardless of access order
/// 3. Detained gas is tracked and refunded at transaction end
/// 4. Users only pay for actual work performed, not for enforcement gas
/// 5. This prevents `DoS` attacks while maintaining fair gas accounting
///
/// # Assumptions
///
/// This instruction table is only used when the `MINI_REX` spec (or later) is enabled, so we can
/// safely assume that all features before and including Mini-Rex are enabled.

/** Volatile data access opcode handlers with compute gas limit enforcement.

These custom instruction handlers override opcodes that access volatile data (block environment,
beneficiary account data) to lower the compute gas limit. This prevents `DoS` attacks while
allowing storage operations to continue with full transaction gas.

# Compute Gas Limit Enforcement

When volatile data is accessed:
1. The opcode executes normally (calls host method, processes data)
2. If this is the first volatile data access in the transaction:
   - The compute gas limit is lowered based on the type:
     * Block environment or beneficiary: `BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_REMAINING_GAS` (20M compute gas)
     * Oracle contract: `ORACLE_ACCESS_REMAINING_GAS` (1M compute gas)
3. Most restrictive limit wins: If additional volatile data with different limit is accessed,
   the minimum (most restrictive) limit is applied, regardless of access order
4. All subsequent compute operations are limited by this compute gas limit
5. Storage operations (SSTORE, account creation) continue with full transaction gas

This approach:
- Prevents `DoS` attacks by limiting compute operations after volatile data access
- Allows storage operations to continue normally (not limited by volatile data access)
- Works across nested calls through the compute gas tracking mechanism
- Order-independent: accessing oracle then block env OR block env then oracle both result in
  the same final compute gas limit (the minimum of the two)

# Two Categories of Opcodes

## Block Environment Opcodes (Always Volatile)
These opcodes ALWAYS access volatile data and apply 20M compute gas limit:
- TIMESTAMP, NUMBER, COINBASE, DIFFICULTY, GASLIMIT, BASEFEE, BLOCKHASH, BLOBBASEFEE, BLOBHASH

## Account-Accessing Opcodes (Conditionally Volatile)
These opcodes only SOMETIMES access volatile data (20M compute gas limit when volatile):
- `BALANCE(beneficiary_address)` → volatile, applies 20M compute gas limit
- `BALANCE(other_address)` → not volatile, no limit
- EXTCODESIZE/EXTCODECOPY/EXTCODEHASH → same conditional behavior

For conditional opcodes:
- The Host methods detect when they access beneficiary/volatile accounts
- Compute gas limit lowering only occurs if volatile data is actually accessed
- Regular account accesses don't trigger limit changes
