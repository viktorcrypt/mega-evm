//! # State Growth Tracking
//!
//! This module implements tracking of **net state growth** during transaction execution.
//! State growth measures the expansion of blockchain state by counting new accounts and
//! storage slots created, offset by any that are cleared.
//!
//! ## What Counts as State Growth
//!
//! State growth is measured in discrete units, where each unit represents:
//!
//! - **+1** for creating a new account (via `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, or `CALL` with value to empty
//!   account)
//! - **+1** for writing a storage slot from zero to non-zero for the first time
//! - **-1** for clearing a storage slot back to zero (only when the slot was empty at transaction
//!   start)
//!
//! ## Net Growth Model
//!
//! This implementation uses a **net growth** model, meaning:
//! - The counter increases when state is created
//! - The counter decreases when state is cleared
//! - The internal `total_growth` can temporarily become negative during execution
//! - The externally reported growth is clamped to a minimum of zero
//!
//! ### Example: Net Growth Calculation
//!
//! ```text
//! Transaction creates 3 new storage slots:    total_growth = +3
//! Transaction clears 1 slot back to zero:     total_growth = +2
//! Transaction clears 2 more slots:            total_growth = 0
//! ```
//!
//! ## Frame-Based Tracking
//!
//! State growth is tracked using a frame stack that mirrors the EVM's call frame stack.
//! This ensures proper handling of reverts:
//!
//! - Each `CALL`/`CREATE` pushes a new frame
//! - Growth within a frame is tracked as "discardable" (can be reverted)
//! - On successful frame exit, growth is merged into the parent frame
//! - On failed frame exit (revert), growth is discarded
//!
//! ### Example: Frame Revert Behavior
//!
//! ```text
//! Main transaction starts:                    Frame 0: discardable = 0
//! Main creates 2 storage slots:               Frame 0: discardable = 2, total = 2
//! Main calls contract A:                      Frame 1: discardable = 0
//! Contract A creates 3 storage slots:         Frame 1: discardable = 3, total = 5
//! Contract A calls contract B:                Frame 2: discardable = 0
//! Contract B creates 1 storage slot:          Frame 2: discardable = 1, total = 6
//! Contract B reverts:                         Frame 2 discarded, total = 5
//! Contract A completes successfully:          Frame 1 merged to Frame 0, total = 5
//! Transaction completes:                      Final growth = 5
//! ```
//!
//! ## EIP-161 Compliance
//!
//! The tracker implements EIP-161 account clearing rules:
//! - Only `CALL`-like opcodes with value transfer to empty accounts count as creating an account
//! - `CALL` without value transfer to empty accounts does not count (empty account remains empty)
//!
//! ## Storage Slot Tracking
//!
//! Storage slot state transitions are tracked based on three values:
//! - `original_value`: Value at the start of the transaction
//! - `present_value`: Current value before the SSTORE
//! - `new_value`: Value being written
//!
//! Only transitions that affect the **transaction-level** state growth are counted:
//! - `(zero, zero, non-zero)`: First write to empty slot → **+1**
//! - `(zero, non-zero, zero)`: Clear a slot that was empty at transaction start → **-1**
//! - Other transitions: No change (slot was already non-zero at transaction start)
