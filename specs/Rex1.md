# Rex1 Specification

## 1. Introduction

Rex1 is the first patch to the Rex hardfork. It addresses a bug in the compute gas limit handling between transactions within the same block.

**Key Change:**

- **Compute Gas Limit Reset**: The transaction's compute gas limit is now properly reset between transactions, preventing the lowered limit from volatile data access in one transaction from affecting subsequent transactions.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 The Problem

In Rex (and earlier specs), when a transaction accesses volatile data such as the oracle contract, the compute gas limit is lowered to prevent excessive computation after accessing time-sensitive data. For example:

- Oracle contract access lowers compute gas limit to 1,000,000 (1M)
- Block environment access lowers compute gas limit to 20,000,000 (20M)

However, a bug existed where this lowered limit would persist to subsequent transactions executed on the same EVM instance within a block. This caused unexpected behavior:

1. **TX1**: Accesses oracle contract → compute gas limit lowered to 1M
2. **TX2**: Normal transaction requiring >1M compute gas → **fails unexpectedly**

TX2 would fail with `ComputeGasLimitExceeded` even though it never accessed any volatile data, because it inherited the lowered limit from TX1.

### 2.2 The Fix

Rex1 ensures that the compute gas limit is reset to its original configured value at the start of each transaction. This means:

1. **TX1**: Accesses oracle contract → compute gas limit lowered to 1M for this transaction only
2. **TX2**: Starts fresh with full compute gas limit (e.g., 10M) → executes normally

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Compute Gas Limit Reset

| Spec         | Behavior                                                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-Rex1** | Compute gas limit persists across transactions within the same block          |
| **Rex1**     | Compute gas limit resets to configured value at the start of each transaction |

In other words, the further restricted compute gas limit after volatile data access is enforced _only_ on the current transaction execution.
If the transaction has already consumed more than the further restricted compute gas limit before the access, the execution will halt immediately.
Later transactions in the same block are not affected.


### 3.2 What Gets Reset

At the start of each transaction (in the `reset()` method of `AdditionalLimit`), the following are reset when Rex1 is enabled:

- `compute_gas_limit`: Reset to the configured transaction compute gas limit
- `compute_gas_used`: Reset to 0

### 3.3 What Remains Unchanged

Rex1 does not change any other behavior from Rex:

- Storage gas economics remain the same
- Transaction intrinsic storage gas remains 39,000
- Transaction and block limits remain the same
- DELEGATECALL/STATICCALL behavior remains consistent with Rex
- All other volatile data access detection and limiting behavior remains the same

## 4. Specification Mapping

The semantics of Rex1 spec are inherited from:

- **Rex1** → **Rex** → **MiniRex** → **Optimism Isthmus** → **Ethereum Prague**
