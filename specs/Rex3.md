# Rex3 Specification

Rex3 is the third patch to the Rex hardfork.
It introduces several behavioral changes while inheriting all Rex2 behavior.

## Changes from Rex2

### 1. Oracle Access Compute Gas Limit Increase

Rex3 increases the compute gas cap applied after oracle contract access:

- **Previous limit (MINI_REX through REX2):** 1,000,000 (1M) compute gas
- **New limit (REX3):** 20,000,000 (20M) compute gas

The block environment access compute gas limit remains unchanged at 20M.
When both block environment and oracle are accessed, both caps are now equal (20M), so neither is more restrictive than the other.

Note that the further restricted compute gas limit is enforced on the compute gas consumption across the entire transaction execution.
That is, if the transaction has already consumed more than 20M compute gas before accessing volatile data (e.g., from an oracle contract or the block environment), the transaction execution will halt immediately.

This change allows transactions that read oracle data to perform more computation after the oracle access, reducing the frequency of `VolatileDataAccessOutOfGas` halts for legitimate use cases.

### 2. Oracle Gas Detention Triggers on SLOAD (not CALL)

In specs prior to Rex3 (MINI_REX through REX2), oracle gas detention is triggered when any CALL targets the oracle contract address.
This means simply calling the oracle contract — even without reading any storage — activates gas detention.

Rex3 changes this so that oracle gas detention is triggered by SLOAD from the oracle contract's storage, not by CALL to the oracle contract.
This more accurately captures actual oracle data access: only transactions that read oracle storage values trigger gas detention.

- **Previous behavior (MINI_REX through REX2):** CALL to oracle contract → triggers gas detention
- **New behavior (REX3):** SLOAD from oracle contract storage → triggers gas detention

The SLOAD-based detention is caller-agnostic: any SLOAD that reads from the oracle contract's storage triggers detention, regardless of which contract initiated the call chain.
For example, if Contract A calls Contract B, which then calls the oracle contract, the oracle's SLOAD triggers detention for the entire transaction.

DELEGATECALL to the oracle contract does **not** trigger detention.
This is because DELEGATECALL executes the oracle's code in the caller's context, so SLOAD reads the caller's storage, not the oracle contract's storage.

The `MEGA_SYSTEM_ADDRESS` exemption applies to the SLOAD-based path, but with a semantic difference from pre-Rex3.
In the pre-Rex3 CALL-based path, the exemption checked the frame-level caller (`call_inputs.caller`).
In Rex3, the exemption checks the transaction sender (`TxEnv.caller` via `Host::caller()`), which means the entire transaction from `MEGA_SYSTEM_ADDRESS` is exempted regardless of call depth.

### 3. Keyless Deploy Compute Gas Tracking

The 100K overhead gas for sandbox execution is deducted from frame gas but never recorded as compute gas.
This means keyless deploy transactions don't count toward the 200M per-transaction compute gas limit.

Rex3 fixes this by recording the keyless deploy overhead gas (100K) as compute gas.
If this causes the compute gas limit to be exceeded, the execution will halt.

- **Previous behavior (REX2):** Keyless deploy overhead gas not counted toward compute gas limit
- **New behavior (REX3):** 100K overhead gas recorded as compute gas

## Inheritance

Rex3 inherits all Rex2 behavior (including SELFDESTRUCT with EIP-6780 semantics, KeylessDeploy system contract, compute gas limit reset between transactions) and all features from Rex1, Rex, and MiniRex.

The semantics of Rex3 are inherited from:

- **Rex3** -> **Rex2** -> **Rex1** -> **Rex** -> **MiniRex** -> **Optimism Isthmus** -> **Ethereum Prague**
